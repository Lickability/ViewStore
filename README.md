# View Store

View Store is an architecture pattern and a protocol used in SwiftUI development inspired by [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture). A view store is an `ObservableObject` that allows us to separate view-specific logic and the rendering of a corresponding view in a way that is repeatable, prescriptive, flexible, and testable by default.
